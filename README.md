This project is about analysing the prices of
food and fuel derivatives in the governorates of Jordan
from 2011 to 2022. The aim is to develop accurate
models to predict future food prices and identify trends.
The documentation covers basic steps such as data
coding, model selection, feature selection, and
evaluation metrics. Various encryption techniques were
explored and the most appropriate method determined.
Regression models, including XGBoost Regression, are
evaluated for accuracy. Feature selection techniques are
applied to identify significant predictors. Evaluation
scales designed for continuous data sets are used to
evaluate model performance.
